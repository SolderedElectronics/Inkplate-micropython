# Soldered Inkplate Micropython library

![](./InkplateImage.jpg)

The Micropython modules for the Inkplate product family can be found in this repository. Inkplate is a series of powerful, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled, ESP32-based ePaper display products. Its main feature is simplicity. Just plug in a USB cable, load the MicroPython firmware and the required libraries and run your script on Inkplate itself. The Inkplate product family currently includes Inkplate 10, Inkplate 6 and Inkplate 6PLUS, Inkplate 6COLOR and Inkplate 2. 
Inkplate 6 was crowdfunded on [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/e-radionica/inkplate-6), as well as [Inkplate 10](https://www.crowdsupply.com/e-radionica/inkplate-10), [Inkplate 6PLUS](https://www.crowdsupply.com/e-radionica/inkplate-6plus) and [Inkplate 6COLOR](https://www.crowdsupply.com/soldered/inkplate-6color). Inkplate 2 was funded on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/solderedelectronics/inkplate-2-a-easy-to-use-arduino-compatible-e-paper).

All available to purchase from [Soldered.com](https://soldered.com/categories/inkplate/).

Original effort to enable MicroPython support for Inkplate was done by [tve](https://github.com/tve/micropython-inkplate6). Thank you!

### Setting up Inkplate with MicroPython

In order to get started with running your code on Inkplate, connect the device to your computer via USB and follow these steps:
1. Download the Inkplate-firmware.bin file onto your computer

2. Flash the aformentioned firmware onto the Inkplate device, this can be done via our [Micropython VSCode Extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SolderedElectronics.soldered-micropython-helper) or the [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/)

#### Flashing with the VSCode extension
After [setting up the VSCode extension](https://soldered.com/documentation/micropython/getting-started-with-vscode/), go to  `Install Micropython on your board` and pick `Upload Binary file from PC`, pick the Inkplate-firmware.bin file and wait for it to flash on the device

#### Flashing via Thonny IDE

In the Thonny IDE, go to `Run -> Configure interpreter` and on the bottom of the window go to `Install or update Micropython`. On the bottom of that window click on the `â‰¡` button and pick `Select local MicroPython image`, pick the Inkplate-firmware.bin file on your computer and press `Install`

3. [Install the mpremote package](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html)

4. With the mpremote package, we can flash the Inkplate modules onto the device with the following command:
   ```
      mpremote mip install github:SolderedElectronics/Inkplate-micropython/YOUR_DEVICE
   ```
   or if you're running a Windows OS:
   ```
      python -m mpremote mip install github:SolderedElectronics/Inkplate-micropython/YOUR_DEVICE
   ```

   For example, if you want to install drivers for the Inkplate6, it will be the following command:
   ```
      mpremote mip install github:SolderedElectronics/Inkplate-micropython/Inkplate6
   ```


**You only have to do steps 1-4 once when writing MicroPython firmware on your Inkplate!** If you have already done this, proceed from step 5 onwards.

5. Now you can flash examples and write code with the IDE of your choosing!


### Code examples

There are several examples which will indicate all the functions you can use in your own script:
* The basic examples show you drawing shapes, lines and text on the screen in different colors, also a bitmap image in a single color
* The network examples show you how to use the network features like doing a GET request and downloading a file
* The batteryAndTemperatureRead examples show you how to read the internal battery status and the temperature from the internal sensor
* The displayImageSd example shows you how to draw a JPG/BMP/PNG image with or without dithering from an SD card
* The displayImageWeb example shows you how to draw a JPG/BMP/PNG image with or without dithering from a URL
* The gpioExpander example shows how to use the GPIO expander on new Inkplate models

More information is provided in the examples themselves in the shape of comments.
